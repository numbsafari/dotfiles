# My CodeSpaces dotfiles

Because GitHub CodeSpaces has decided to rather unartfully squat on the ~/dotfiles
project convention, I've moved my personal dotfiles to a private repo and will be
keeping my CodeSpaces-specific dotfiles here.

I think it would be great it GitHub provided a mechanism for orgs to create an
org-wide `dotfiles` project, where each user can have a branch named after
them that allows them to tweak it, but allows the team some isolation from the
vagaries of public repos.

Similarly, rather than squatting on the `main` branch of each repo, I wish
GitHub allowed the user to specify which branch they want to use for
CodeSpaces, perhaps even specifying it on a per project-basis. This is a
common convention already for, e.g., handling Linux vs. MacOS settings.

Anyhow, I'm happy to work around this because CodeSpaces itself is pretty
freaking useful even in its current state, and I'm hoping that they'll
implement these kinds of features at somepoint once the crush of
operationalizing the world's developer environments calms down a bit.
